写一个函数删除单链表中的一个节点（不是尾节点），假设只给定待删除的节点
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, 
the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
